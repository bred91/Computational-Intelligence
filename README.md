# Computational Intelligence 2022-2023
Repository by Raffaele Pane for the Computational Intelligence course 2022-2023

## Life background
I am a student/worker.<br>
I often manage well both aspects of my life, but on some occasions I may not be able to fully keep up with the course.

## Python background
I started this course with a basic knowledge of the Python language.<br>
I knew the essentials of the language and had minimal experience with some libraries for Data Science and Machine Learning.

### Week 8
I had some time to catch up on things and do some experiments.

I wrote an improved version of the Lab 2 algorithm, in which I added and tried things that I had not been able to write before due to lack of time. [link](https://github.com/bred91/Computational_Intelligence_2022-2023/blob/main/lab2/Lab_2_upgraded.ipynb)

I also wrote the code for both the Sphere and the Rastrigin problem. [link](https://github.com/bred91/Computational_Intelligence_2022-2023/tree/main/Hill%20Climbing)
