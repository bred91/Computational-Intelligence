# Computational Intelligence 2022-2023
Repository by Raffaele Pane for the Computational Intelligence course 2022-2023

## Life background
I am a student/worker.<br>
I often manage well both aspects of my life, but on some occasions I may not be able to fully keep up with the course.

## Python background
I started this course with a basic knowledge of the Python language.<br>
I knew the essentials of the language and had minimal experience with some libraries for Data Science and Machine Learning.

## Diary

- [my choice](https://github.com/marcopra/computational_intellligence_22_23_294815/issues/2#issue-1419233615)

### Week 5
"Crunch Time" at work   :/<br>
I will catch up with the lessons as soon as possible!

### Week 6
Lab 2: Set Covering (with GA)  [link](https://github.com/bred91/Computational_Intelligence_2022-2023/tree/main/lab2)

### Week 7
Peer Review of Lab 2
- [review 1](https://github.com/md131376st/computational-intelligen-2022/issues/3#issue-1445751115)
- [review 2](https://github.com/tonatiu92/Computational-Intelligence-CI-2022-01URROV-s307107/issues/3#issue-1446517772)

### Week 8
I had some time to catch up on things and do some experiments.

I wrote an improved version of the Lab 2 algorithm, in which I added and tried things that I had not been able to write before due to lack of time. [link](https://github.com/bred91/Computational_Intelligence_2022-2023/blob/main/lab2/Lab_2_upgraded.ipynb)

I also wrote the code for both the Sphere and the Rastrigin problem. [link](https://github.com/bred91/Computational_Intelligence_2022-2023/tree/main/Hill%20Climbing)

### Week 9 / 10
Started the work on lab 3 (task 1, 2 and 3, done) [link](https://github.com/bred91/Computational_Intelligence_2022-2023/tree/main/lab3)

Note: since I wrote a big part of the solution before the changes made by the professor, there are some things a bit different from the expected ones.

### Week 11
Task 4 of lab 3 completed!!! :fire: [link](https://github.com/bred91/Computational_Intelligence_2022-2023/tree/main/lab3)<br>
This one was really tough!
